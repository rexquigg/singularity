# Singularity

Calculate the CRC of a Bitcoin address of your choosing, as well as all
permutations of capitalization for that address.

The output is all addresses whose CRC matches a word list.

*Warning*: The private key for addresses generated is not known, any
transactions sent to the addresses generated by this program will not be
spendable.

## Usage

Run this script from the command line, with an argument for the address you are
attempting to generate. The address specified must contain a valid length, but
need not contain a valid CRC, which is the last six characters. Keep as many
characters lower case as is possible, since the script only adds capitalization.

Characters which can not appear in the address template are the uppercase
"O", the uppercase "I", the lowercase "l", and the number "0".

Some addresses will decode to an internal length which is impossible.
Most addresses will need to start with the numbers 2-9 or capital letters A-Q
and be 34 characters long to pass this requirement.
